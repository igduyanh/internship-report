## Objective

After completing the workshop, you will clean up the resources you created to avoid unnecessary charges, prevent dependency issues, and leave the AWS environment in a clean state.

## Service explanation

Several resources in this workshop depend on one another. For example, CloudFront must be disabled before deletion, WAF needs its associations removed before deletion, and NAT Gateway must finish deleting before the next resources can be removed. Following the correct order helps you avoid errors and save time.

## Prerequisites

- You have completed all workshop deployment steps.
- You have saved any logs, snapshots, or documents you may need.
- You agree to remove the resources created during the workshop.


## Step 1. Delete the CloudFront distribution

1. Open the Amazon CloudFront console.
2. Select the `soc-platform` distribution.
3. Click **Disable** and wait for the status to become **Disabled**.
4. After it is disabled, select the distribution and click **Delete**.
